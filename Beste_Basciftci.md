# About me #

I am Beste, a double major student at computer engineering and industrial engineering departments. My initial department is CMPE. Although I am not much pleased about coding, I am happy to be a student at this department.

I like listening music, playing piano and travelling. Also, at my spare times, I like playing tennis and watching tennis matches a lot.
