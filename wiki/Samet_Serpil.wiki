=About Me=

I'm a Computer Engineering student at Boğaziçi University. I'm very curious about the computers since the moment that I've touched a mouse first time in my life. During the first years of the high school, I was planning to be a civil engineer. However, my classmate who is my best friend, convinced me to become a computer engineer. Now, we're both students of the computer engineering department.
