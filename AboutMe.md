**Hi all!**

I am Eyl√ºl, a senior student in CMPE. As an unusual thing, I have already taken CMPE451, so I reverted the order of classes :S However, I believe that my experiences from the past course will help us on the way of introducing our project.

I like travelling a lot. I have spend a semester in Netherlands as an Erasmus student, I've made an internship abroad. But of course the best experience was interrail :) Talking about the things that I do when I am not travelling, I take photos, lots of photos. I have an amateur machine, Nikon D3000, and would like share some experience if you're insterested. And if you don't know yet, there is a great tool at this website _www.picnik.com_, for photo editing.  I also started to cook this semester, thanks to my flatmate who cooks a lot of sweets, apple pies, muffins etc. I used to play classical guitar, but I am not good at it anymore.

Can't wait to meet you, I wish you all a happy and successful semester!
